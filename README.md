Obviously, no more need to know any programming language. Just ask AI, and AI will write the code you need using multiple languages.

This is just an example of why no more anyone needs to spend money and waste time to learn programming. Instead, to be a programmer. Now you need to be a project manager using AI. Programming as we knew it became dead more than anyone expected. The question is which profession will be next replaced by AI?

To write the following code, we need to know PHP. Python and JS and spend some time. Now using AI, it can be done in less than a minute. At least, it can create a basic project skeleton that can be expanded or changed anytime.
Additionally, AI gave us explanations so we can learn new languages on the fly.

## Summary:
No more, no one entrepreneur with basic IT knowledge, no more need for programmers. All jobs he can do on his own using AI services.


Here is conversation (Of course, this is just simplest test of AI. I could ask more derailed request, E.G. type of API, authentification, Class mames, tables shemas etc.):

Hi Ai!
Are you familiar with micro services?
ChatGPT said:

Hi there! Yes, I'm familiar with microservices.

A microservices architecture is a design pattern for developing software applications where the application is broken down into smaller, loosely coupled services. Each microservice focuses on a specific business function and operates independently, communicating with other services over standard protocols (like HTTP/REST, gRPC, or messaging queues).

Here are some key characteristics of microservices:

    Independence: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of others.

    Focused on a Single Responsibility: Microservices are typically small and focused on a specific business function (e.g., user management, payment processing, etc.).

    Communication via APIs: Microservices communicate with each other using lightweight protocols, often HTTP-based APIs (e.g., REST or GraphQL) or message brokers.

    Technology Agnostic: Each service can be written in a different programming language or use different technologies, making it more flexible and allowing developers to use the best tool for the job.

    Resilience: Failures in one microservice donâ€™t necessarily bring down the whole system, making the system more fault-tolerant.

    Scalability: Microservices can be independently scaled based on demand, allowing more flexibility in resource allocation.

    Continuous Deployment: Because microservices are decoupled, they enable faster development cycles and continuous deployment, as one service can be updated without affecting others.

Would you like to dive deeper into any of these points, or maybe discuss how to implement a microservices architecture?

Can we try micro services project using example? Can you write some basic code containing 3 micros services. One  micro service written in PHP second in Python third in JS. 
E.G Php provides data from some hypothetical MariaDB tables. Python micro service  use data provided by requested from PHP DB micro service and made basic statistics/analytics (e.g. mid, median and average values from given php micro service DB data(e.g. statics/analytics operation on users age, gender, etc.).
And finally JS micro service get calculated statistics/analytics from python micro service and draw some graph in web browser.

Sure! Let's break this down step by step to understand how we can build a microservices project with three different services: one in PHP, another in Python, and a third in JavaScript. We'll use basic HTTP requests for communication between the services.
Architecture Overview:

    PHP Service (Database Service):
        A basic service that interacts with a MariaDB database and provides data (like user data with age, gender, etc.).

    Python Service (Analytics Service):
        This service takes the data from the PHP service and performs basic statistics/analytics on it (like calculating mean, median, and mode of the age).

    JavaScript Service (Frontend):
        A frontend service that fetches the statistical data from the Python service and displays it as a graph on the web page using something like Chart.js.

Step-by-Step Setup:
1. PHP Microservice (Database Service)

This service will interact with a MariaDB database and return some sample data (e.g., user age, gender).
Requirements:

    PHP
    MariaDB (or MySQL)

PHP Code (service.php):

<?php
// PHP Service that returns user data from a MariaDB database

// Database connection (adjust credentials as needed)
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "testdb";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

header('Content-Type: application/json');

// Fetch user data from DB
$sql = "SELECT id, age, gender FROM users";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

$data = [];
if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        $data[] = $row;
    }
}

// Return the data as JSON
echo json_encode($data);

$conn->close();
?>

Database Setup (MariaDB):

    Install MariaDB (or MySQL).
    Create a database testdb and a table users.

CREATE DATABASE testdb;
USE testdb;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    age INT,
    gender ENUM('Male', 'Female')
);

INSERT INTO users (age, gender) VALUES (25, 'Male');
INSERT INTO users (age, gender) VALUES (30, 'Female');
INSERT INTO users (age, gender) VALUES (22, 'Female');
INSERT INTO users (age, gender) VALUES (35, 'Male');

2. Python Microservice (Analytics Service)

The Python service will retrieve data from the PHP service and calculate statistics (mean, median, etc.).
Requirements:

    Flask
    Requests library

Install necessary packages:

pip install flask requests numpy

Python Code (analytics.py):

from flask import Flask, jsonify
import requests
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)

PHP_SERVICE_URL = "http://localhost/service.php"  # PHP Service URL

@app.route('/analytics', methods=['GET'])
def get_analytics():
    # Get data from PHP service
    response = requests.get(PHP_SERVICE_URL)
    users_data = response.json()

    # Extract ages
    ages = [user['age'] for user in users_data]
    
    # Calculate basic statistics
    mean = np.mean(ages)
    median = np.median(ages)
    mode = float(np.argmax(np.bincount(ages)))

    # Return analytics as JSON
    analytics = {
        "mean": mean,
        "median": median,
        "mode": mode
    }
    
    return jsonify(analytics)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

3. JavaScript Microservice (Frontend)

This service will be a simple webpage that fetches the statistics from the Python service and draws a graph.
Requirements:

    Basic HTML/JS
    Chart.js (for graph plotting)

HTML + JavaScript Code (index.html):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Microservices Analytics</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Statistics from Analytics Service</h1>
<div>
    <canvas id="myChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
</div>

<script>
// Fetch data from Python analytics service
fetch('http://localhost:5000/analytics')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Data from Python service
        console.log(data);

        // Create a chart
        const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
        const myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
            type: 'bar',
            data: {
                labels: ['Mean', 'Median', 'Mode'],
                datasets: [{
                    label: 'User Age Statistics',
                    data: [data.mean, data.median, data.mode],
                    backgroundColor: [
                        'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
                        'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                        'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)'
                    ],
                    borderColor: [
                        'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                        'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                        'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)'
                    ],
                    borderWidth: 1
                }]
            },
            options: {
                scales: {
                    y: {
                        beginAtZero: true
                    }
                }
            }
        });
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));

</script>
</body>
</html>

How It All Works Together:

    PHP Service (Database):
        Hosts a basic endpoint (/service.php) that returns user data from a MariaDB database in JSON format.
    Python Service (Analytics):
        The Python service listens on port 5000 and exposes an endpoint (/analytics) that makes an HTTP request to the PHP service, receives the user data, and calculates basic statistics like the mean, median, and mode of the users' ages.
    JavaScript Frontend:
        The HTML page makes a request to the Python service (/analytics), fetches the statistics, and visualizes the data in a bar chart using Chart.js.

How to Run:

    PHP Service:
        Set up the PHP server with your service.php.
        Ensure your MariaDB (or MySQL) server is running, and that the testdb and users table are set up.

    Python Service:
        Run the Python service with python analytics.py.

    Frontend:
        Open the index.html file in a browser.

This setup demonstrates a basic microservices architecture where different technologies (PHP, Python, JS) are used to solve different parts of the problem: PHP for data storage, Python for analytics, and JS for visualization.

You said:
I just had another thought. Can we put those three micro services in docker and call them via docker compose start?
What would that look like?


Absolutely! Docker is a great tool for managing microservices, as it allows you to containerize each service and run them independently with all their dependencies bundled together. By using **Docker Compose**, you can easily manage multiple containers (your microservices) and orchestrate them to run together.

Letâ€™s walk through how to containerize the **PHP**, **Python**, and **JavaScript** services, and use **Docker Compose** to manage them.

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide: Dockerizing Your Microservices**

#### **1. Dockerizing the PHP Service (Database Service)**

##### **Dockerfile for PHP Service**
To containerize the PHP service, youâ€™ll need a `Dockerfile` that sets up PHP, installs Apache (or any other web server), and configures the service to run.

**Dockerfile for PHP (service/Dockerfile)**:
```Dockerfile
# Use an official PHP image with Apache
FROM php:8.0-apache

# Install required dependencies (e.g., MySQL extension)
RUN docker-php-ext-install mysqli

# Enable Apache mod_rewrite (optional)
RUN a2enmod rewrite

# Copy the PHP service files into the container
COPY service.php /var/www/html/

# Expose port 80 to the host
EXPOSE 80
```

##### **Docker Compose Configuration for PHP Service**

Youâ€™ll also need to configure the `docker-compose.yml` file to create a container for PHP.

---

#### **2. Dockerizing the Python Service (Analytics Service)**

##### **Dockerfile for Python Service**
Create a `Dockerfile` that will set up a Python environment, install dependencies, and run the Flask app.

**Dockerfile for Python (analytics/Dockerfile)**:
```Dockerfile
# Use a Python base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install necessary Python packages
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the Python service code
COPY analytics.py /app/

# Expose port 5000 for Flask
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the Flask app
CMD ["python", "analytics.py"]
```

##### **requirements.txt for Python** (for Flask and requests):
```txt
flask
requests
numpy
```

---

#### **3. Dockerizing the JavaScript Service (Frontend)**

The JavaScript service is a static website, so we can use a simple **Nginx** server to serve the HTML and JavaScript files.

##### **Dockerfile for JavaScript (frontend/Dockerfile)**:
```Dockerfile
# Use Nginx to serve static files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the frontend HTML file into the container
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Expose port 80 for the web server
EXPOSE 80
```

---

#### **4. Docker Compose Configuration**

Now letâ€™s define everything in a **`docker-compose.yml`** file to orchestrate the services.

##### **docker-compose.yml**:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # PHP Service (Database Service)
  php-service:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: service/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - microservices-network

  # Python Service (Analytics Service)
  python-service:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: analytics/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - php-service
    networks:
      - microservices-network

  # MariaDB Database
  db:
    image: mariadb:latest
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: testdb
    networks:
      - microservices-network

  # JS Service (Frontend)
  js-service:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: frontend/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - python-service
    networks:
      - microservices-network

networks:
  microservices-network:
    driver: bridge
```

### **Explanation:**

- **`php-service`**: This builds from the `service/Dockerfile`, binds port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host. It also depends on the **MariaDB** service, as it needs a database.
  
- **`python-service`**: Builds from the `analytics/Dockerfile`, binds port 5000 inside the container to port 5000 on the host. It depends on the **PHP service** for the data.

- **`db`**: Uses the official `mariadb` Docker image to run the database. It will initialize the `testdb` database with a root password. The other services depend on this database.

- **`js-service`**: Builds from the `frontend/Dockerfile` and binds port 80 inside the container to port 80 on the host. It depends on the **Python service** to get the statistics and display the graph.

- **Networks**: All services are connected to the same Docker network (`microservices-network`) so they can communicate with each other.

---

### **5. Running the Microservices**

Now that everything is set up, we can use **Docker Compose** to bring up the entire system with a single command.

1. **Build and start the services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the images for all services and start the containers. If it's the first time you are running it, Docker Compose will pull any missing base images (like `nginx` or `mariadb`) and build the custom images you defined with the `Dockerfile`.

2. **Access the services**:
   - **PHP Service**: `http://localhost:8080/service.php`
   - **Python Service**: `http://localhost:5000/analytics`
   - **JavaScript Service**: `http://localhost:80` (This will show the chart)

---

### **6. Stopping the Services**

If you want to stop all the services and remove the containers, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This stops and removes the containers, but leaves the images intact. If you want to completely clean up the images as well, run:

```bash
docker-compose down --rmi all
```

---

### **Summary of the Dockerized Microservices Workflow:**

1. **PHP Service** (`service.php`) serves data from MariaDB (user age and gender).
2. **Python Service** (Flask) takes this data, performs analytics, and exposes it via an HTTP API.
3. **JavaScript Service** (using **Chart.js**) fetches the analytics data from the Python service and visualizes it in a bar chart.

Each service runs in its own Docker container and communicates over a Docker network. Docker Compose makes it easy to manage and orchestrate these services.

---

### Final Thoughts:
- This approach makes it easy to test and deploy microservices independently, while keeping everything in isolated containers.
- You can add more services or scale individual services up and down with Docker Compose commands.
